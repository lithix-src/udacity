* motion
  - lets say we have a prior in the form of probability distribution 
    | 1/9 | 1/3 | 1/3 | 1/9 | 1/9 |
    | d   |     |     | d   | d   |
    - and we know the robot moves 1 cell to the right
    - and that the world is cyclic, returns on itself
    - what's our posterior probabiltiy distribution
      - above is the initial belief state of where the robot believes it could be
      - if it moves to the right by 1 cell
	- and moving right has P(1) of succeeding
         | 1/9 | 1/9 | 1/3 | 1/3 | 1/9 |
         | d   | d   |     |     | d   |
	  - we're measuring belief of where we are in a world based on landmarks
	  - so if robot is infront of a door, it doesn'nt neccessarily know
	    which door. all it knows is the positions of doors
	  - moving to the right, taking into account what we know of the world
	    shifts the probabilities by N number of units of motion
